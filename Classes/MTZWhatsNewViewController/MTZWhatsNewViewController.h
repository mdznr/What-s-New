/// @c MTZWhatsNewViewController is an abstract base class for "What’s New" view controller classes. Included in the project is a subclass of @c MTZWhatsNewViewController, @c MTZWhatsNewGridViewController, which presents features in a list or grid layout (depending on the context). Only subclass @c MTZWhatsNewViewController if you want a custom presentation, otherwise @c MTZwhatsNewGridViewController is recommended.

#pragma mark - Accessing Views

///	Returns the content view of view controller. (read-only)
/// @discussion The content view of a @c MTZWhatsNewViewController object is the default superview for content displayed by the controller. If you want to customize it by simply adding additional views, you should add them to the content view so they will be positioned appropriately.

#pragma mark - Responding to Style Change

///	Notifies the view controller that the effective style has been changed.
/// @discussion This method is called when the style has been changed. You should override this method to perform custom tasks associated with changing the style. If you override this method, you must call super at some point in your implementation. Note that this can be called when the receiver’s @c automaticallySetStyle is set to @c YES and not only after changes are made directly to the @c style property.
